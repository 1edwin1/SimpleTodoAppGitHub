## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The greatest issue I had in the beginning was setting it up with a modern version of android studio compared to the old videos. At first I tried doing this last year but I
had some personal problems and left it unfinished, but when I decided to do the project again I ran to the issue of the gradle version with android studio which left me
unable to do anything until I just had to reinstall android studio completely. another issue I encountered was some grammar mistakes along with finding key shortcuts to keep
up with the video without pausing it oftenly. Other than that everything else went really smoothly
